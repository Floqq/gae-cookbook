If you would like to contribute, please open a github issue:

* https://github.com/Floqq/gae-cookbook/issues

If a contribution adds new platforms or platform versions, indicate
such in the body of the commit message(s), and update the relevant
issue. When writing commit messages, it is helpful for others if
you indicate the issue. For example:

    git commit -m 'closes #33 Improved support for...'

In the issue itself, it is also helpful if you include log output of
a successful Chef run, but this is not absolutely required.
